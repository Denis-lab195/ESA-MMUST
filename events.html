                    <h3>Annual Football Tournament</h3>
                    <p>MMUST Engineering Student Association Holds Annual Tournament, Bridging Academia and Industry
                        Engineering students celebrate their victory as they proudly lift the trophy for the 2024 tournament.
                        
                        The Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology’s (MMUST) Engineering Students Association (ESA) from 10 to 11 February 2024, hosted its highly anticipated Annual Tournament at the Approved School grounds. The event, marked by a series of games and sports, served as a vibrant platform where aspiring engineers showcased their talents while establishing invaluable connections with key industry players. The event was organised by ESA Leadership alongside ESA Patron Dr. Micah Mukolwe. This demonstrated the association’s commitment to bridging the gap between academia and industry in a dynamic and collaborative setting, while also fostering a sense of unity among ESA students. The tournament, which was sponsored by the Kenya Power and Lightning Company (KPLC) was graced by the Associate Dean- School of Engineering and Built Environment, Dr. Peter Cherop, who was representing the Dean, Prof. Eng. Bernadette Sabuni.
                        
                        “We have had a longstanding partnership with KPLC, but incorporating sports has truly elevated our collaboration,” remarked Dr. Cherop. With gratitude, he commended KPLC and the ESA teams for orchestrating such a remarkable event, anticipating continued collaboration and a myriad of future activities.</p>

                        The SEBE staff and students as well as KPLC teams participated in the football match and chess games through the weekend. Spectators were treated to an exhilarating showcase of skill and sportsmanship, as each team battled for the prestigious tournament title and grand award. It is worth noting that the 5th-year team showcased their resilience and skill, ultimately clinching the tournament title and solidifying their status as champions of the 2024 tournament.</p>
